user_description: I have five years of professional experience building websites and applications. My expertise is mostly Javascript-based but I am more than happy to learn new languages and technologies for the job. I strive to write functional, modular, and clean code to build cool things that solve a common problem. I believe that empathy is key to building a great product.
